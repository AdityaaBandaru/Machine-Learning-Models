🎯 Purchase Prediction using Logistic Regression
(NOTE: To check the results implement the code in google colab or in the software of your choice)
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective implementation of a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary, using the Social_Network_Ads dataset.

📂 Dataset Overview

Rows: 400
Features:
Age (18–60 years)
Estimated Salary (15k–150k)
Purchased (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
