# 🧠 Consumer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest
(NOTE: To check the other results implement the code in your desired software)
This project explores the use of **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classification algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to **buy** a product based on their demographic and personal information.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset is synthetically generated and contains the following features:

- **Age**: Person's age (18–60)
- **Income**: Annual income (20,000–120,000)
- **EducationLevel**: Categorical (High School, Bachelors, Masters, PhD)
- **MaritalStatus**: Categorical (Single, Married, Divorced)
- **OwnsHouse**: Binary (Yes/No)
- **Target**: Binary (Buy / Not Buy)

> ✅ Categorical values were label-encoded for model training.

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Compare performance of **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers.
- Identify which model gives better predictive performance for the given dataset.

---

## ⚙️ Models Used

### 1. Decision Tree Classifier 🌳

- Trained on the encoded dataset
- Simple and interpretable model
- **Accuracy Achieved**: `0.48`

### 2. Random Forest Classifier 🌲🌲🌲

- Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
- Helps reduce overfitting and improve generalization
- **Accuracy Achieved**: `0.62`

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

Although Decision Trees are easy to interpret and visualize, they often suffer from **overfitting**. On the other hand, the **Random Forest** classifier demonstrated significantly better accuracy due to its ensemble approach, making it the preferred choice for this task.
