# 🧠 Naive Bayes Classifier on Categorical Dataset
(NOTE: To check the other results please implement the code in your desired software of use
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Naive Bayes classification model** using a custom categorical dataset involving user attributes (like Age, Income, Student status, Credit Rating) to predict whether a person is likely to buy a computer.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

**Filename**: `naive_bayes_dataset.csv`

| Age        | Income | Student | Credit_Rating | Buys_Computer |
|------------|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Youth      | High   | No      | Fair           | No             |
| Senior     | Low    | Yes     | Excellent      | No             |
| ...        | ...    | ...     | ...            | ...            |

- Total Samples: **14**
- Features: **Age, Income, Student, Credit Rating** (All Categorical)
- Target: **Buys_Computer** (Yes/No)

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. Label Encoding of categorical variables
2. Train-test split (75/25)
3. Training using **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
4. Plotting decision boundaries
5. Evaluating with accuracy & confusion matrix

## 📈 Results

### ✅ Accuracy Score
- 0.76

### 🔁 Confusion Matrix
[[1 1]
[0 2]]


|               | Predicted No | Predicted Yes |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Actual No     | 1            | 1              |
| Actual Yes    | 0            | 2              |

- Model predicted 2 out of 3 "Yes" labels correctly
- Slight misclassification on "No" class

## 📊 Visuals

Plots show decision boundaries for two selected features: **Age** and **Income**  
(All features were used in training, but only two used for 2D visualisation)

## 🧠 Conclusion

The Naive Bayes classifier performs reasonably well on this small categorical dataset, achieving **~66.7% accuracy** with minor misclassification. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of probabilistic models even on low-dimensional, encoded categorical data.
