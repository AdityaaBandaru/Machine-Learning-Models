# Hierarchical Clustering Project  
(NOTE: Implement the code in your desired software to see the results)
This repository demonstrates the implementation of **Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative Clustering)** on a synthetic dataset with multiple features. The project covers data preparation, dendrogram visualization, clustering, and cluster visualization using both raw features and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## 📂 Dataset  
- **File:** `hierarchical_clustering_dataset.csv`  
- **Samples:** 300  
- **Features:** 4 numerical features (`Feature1`, `Feature2`, `Feature3`, `Feature4`)  
- **TrueCluster (optional):** Provided only for validation and evaluation purposes. Not used in clustering.  

---

## 🔑 Methodology  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load dataset  
   - Select feature columns for clustering  

2. **Dendrogram Analysis**  
   - Construct dendrogram using Ward’s linkage  
   - Determine optimal number of clusters  

3. **Agglomerative Clustering**  
   - Apply hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward linkage  
   - Assign cluster labels to each observation  

4. **Visualization**  
   - Plot clusters using selected features (2D)  
   - Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction to visualize all features in 2D

📊 Results
   - The dendrogram clearly indicated 5 clusters, matching the underlying dataset structure.
   - Agglomerative clustering successfully grouped points into meaningful clusters.
   - Visualization in both raw feature space and PCA-reduced space confirms distinct separation between clusters.
   - Predicted clusters align closely with the TrueCluster labels provided in the dataset.
