💼 Salary Prediction with Random Forest Regression
(NOTE: To check the results implement the code in google colab or in the software of your own choice)
Predicting salaries based on experience, certifications, performance, and more using a Random Forest Regressor. The dataset includes missing values, simulating real-world challenges in data science workflows.

📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset Position_Salaries_with_Missing.csv contains 10 samples with the following columns:

Position: Position index (1–10)
Experience_Years: Number of years of experience (with NaNs)
Education_Level: Categorical education level (High School to PhD)
Certifications: Number of certifications (with NaNs)
Projects_Led: Projects led by the employee (with NaNs)
Performance_Score: A float score from 1 to 5
Salary: Target value, includes missing entries

🚀 Results
R² Score (on training set): ~0.98
Mean Absolute Error: Low (±$2,000–$3,000 range)
Model successfully handled missing data and predicted realistic salary ranges for synthetic data.
📌 Note: Due to the small dataset size, results are not generalizable but serve as a strong proof-of-concept.
