# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models Collection

Welcome to my curated repository of **machine learning models**, created using Python and key libraries like **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. This repo serves as both a learning archive and a showcase of applied ML techniques in real-world scenarios.
