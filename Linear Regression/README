🎓 Student Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This project applies a simple linear regression model to predict student test scores based on the number of hours they study. It demonstrates the use of supervised learning for regression tasks with clear visualizations and model evaluation.

📌 Project Overview

Goal: Predict a student's test score given their study hours.
Technique: Simple Linear Regression
Dataset: Custom dataset of 15 students with Hours_Studied and Test_Score
🔧 Steps Performed

Data Exploration
Scatter plot and correlation analysis
Model Building
Trained linear regression model using sklearn
Visualization
Regression line over scatter plot
Residual plot
📈 Results

The model shows a strong positive linear relationship between study hours and scores.
It can reasonably predict scores for new data within the training range.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python
Pandas, NumPy
