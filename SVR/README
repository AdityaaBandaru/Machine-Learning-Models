💼 SVR Salary Prediction
(NOTE: To check the results implement the code in google colab or the software of your choice)
This project implements a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict salaries based on job position level and experience. It uses a dataset with missing salary values and applies preprocessing steps like imputation and feature scaling.

📂 Dataset

A sample employee dataset with the following columns:

Position : Job title (e.g., Intern, CEO)
Position_Level : Numerical label for role seniority
Years_of_Experience : Total years in the role
Salary : Target variable (annual income)
Some rows contain missing salary values.
⚙️ Features

🧼 Imputation of missing salary values (mean strategy)
📊 Standard Scaling of input and output variables
🧠 Support Vector Regression with RBF kernel
📈 Prediction of salary for new position levels
🖼️ Graphical visualization of the SVR curve vs actual salaries
