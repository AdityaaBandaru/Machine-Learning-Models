🏋️‍♂️ Gym Membership Classifier using K-Nearest Neighbors
(NOTE: To check the results implement the code in google colab or in the software of your own choice)
This project builds a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) classifier to predict whether a person is a regular gym-goer based on their age and monthly membership fee. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset designed to mimic realistic gym behavior patterns.

📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:

Age: Age of the individual (18–60)
MonthlyFee: Monthly gym subscription fee (in USD)
RegularGymGoer: Target label (1 for regular, 0 for not)
🧠 The dataset simulates behavior where young or budget-conscious individuals are more likely to attend regularly.

⚙️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy for data handling
Matplotlib for visualization
Scikit-learn for K-NN classification
🚀 How It Works

Preprocessing:
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Modeling:
K-Nearest Neighbors classifier (KNeighborsClassifier)
Train-test split (75%-25%)
Prediction:
Predicts if a new person is likely a regular gym-goer


📈 Results
Accuracy: ~90% on test data
