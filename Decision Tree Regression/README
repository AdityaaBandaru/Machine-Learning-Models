💼 Decision Tree Salary Prediction
(NOTE: To check the graph check out the code and implement it in google colab or any software of your choice)

This project implements a Decision Tree Regression model to predict employee salaries based on their position level, years at the company, and performance score. It uses a dataset with missing values and applies preprocessing steps like imputation before training the model.

📂 Dataset

A realistic employee dataset with the following columns:

Position : Job title (e.g., Intern, CEO)
Level : Numerical level representing role seniority
Years_at_Company : Time spent at the company (some values are missing)
Performance_Score : Annual performance rating out of 5 (some values are missing)
Salary : Target variable (annual compensation, includes NaNs)
🧩 Some rows contain missing data and are preprocessed using SimpleImputer.
⚙️ Features

🧼 Imputation of Missing Values using mean strategy
📊 Feature Extraction from numerical and categorical columns
🌳 Decision Tree Regression to model salary trends across levels
📈 Prediction of salary for unseen levels or incomplete records
🖼️ Graphical visualization of the Decision Tree results

🧪 Results
📉 Model output for level = 6.5:
Predicted Salary = 150000.0
